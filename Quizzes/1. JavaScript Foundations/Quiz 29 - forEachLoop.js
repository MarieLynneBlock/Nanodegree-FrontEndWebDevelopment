QUIZ 29:

Directions:
Use the array's forEach() method to loop over the following array and add 100 to each of the values if the value is divisible by 3.

var test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4, 19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299, 6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139];
Remember that the "Test Run" button will display any logged content, so feel free to use console.log() to test your code.


Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.


Things to note:
- you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
- you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable when you're finished looping
